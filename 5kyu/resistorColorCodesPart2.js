// 5 kyu Resistor Color Codes, Part 2
//
// Resistors are electrical components marked with colorful stripes/bands to indicate
// both their resistance value in ohms and how tight a tolerance that value has.
// If you did my Resistor Color Codes kata, you wrote a function which took
// a string containing a resistor's band colors, and returned a string identifying the resistor's ohms and tolerance values.
//
// Well, now you need that in reverse: The previous owner of your "Beyond-Ultimate Raspberry Pi Starter Kit"
// (as featured in my Fizz Buzz Cuckoo Clock kata) had emptied all the tiny labeled
// zip-lock bags of components into the box, so that for each resistor you need
// for a project, instead of looking for text on a label, you need
// to find one with the sequence of band colors that matches the ohms value you need.
//
// The resistor color codes
//
// You can see this Wikipedia page for a colorful chart, but the basic resistor color codes are:
//
// 0: black, 1: brown, 2: red, 3: orange, 4: yellow, 5: green, 6: blue, 7: violet, 8: gray, 9: white
//
// All resistors have at least three bands, with the first and second bands indicating
// the first two digits of the ohms value, and the third indicating the power of ten
// to multiply them by, for example a resistor with a value of 47 ohms, which equals 47 * 10^0 ohms, would
// have the three bands "yellow violet black".
//
// Most resistors also have a fourth band indicating tolerance -- in an electronics kit
// like yours, the tolerance will always be 5%, which is indicated by a gold band.
// So in your kit, the 47-ohm resistor in the above paragraph would have the four bands "yellow violet black gold".
// Your mission
//
// Your function will receive a string containing the ohms value you need, followed by a space and the word "ohms"
// (to avoid Codewars unicode headaches I'm just using the word instead of the ohms unicode symbol).
//   The way an ohms value is formatted depends on the magnitude of the value:
//
//     For resistors less than 1000 ohms, the ohms value is just formatted as the plain number.
//     For example, with the 47-ohm resistor above, your function would receive
//     the string "47 ohms", and return the string `"yellow violet black gold".
//
//     For resistors greater than or equal to 1000 ohms, but less than 1000000 ohms, the ohms value
//     is divided by 1000, and has a lower-case "k" after it.
//     For example, if your function received the string "4.7k ohms", it would need to return the string "yellow violet red gold".
//
//     For resistors of 1000000 ohms or greater, the ohms value is divided
//     by 1000000, and has an upper-case "M" after it.
//     For example, if your function received the string "1M ohms", it would need to return the string "brown black green gold".
//
// Test case resistor values will all be between 10 ohms and 990M ohms.
// More examples, featuring some common resistor values from your kit
//
// "10 ohms"        "brown black black gold"
// "100 ohms"       "brown black brown gold"
// "220 ohms"       "red red brown gold"
// "330 ohms"       "orange orange brown gold"
// "470 ohms"       "yellow violet brown gold"
// "680 ohms"       "blue gray brown gold"
// "1k ohms"        "brown black red gold"
// "10k ohms"       "brown black orange gold"
// "22k ohms"       "red red orange gold"
// "47k ohms"       "yellow violet orange gold"
// "100k ohms"      "brown black yellow gold"
// "330k ohms"      "orange orange yellow gold"
// "2M ohms"        "red black green gold"
