// 6 kyu Help Green Lantern with his web site
//
// Green Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control
// have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site.
// Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely
// brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he
// finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed
//
// In brightest day, in blackest night,
// There's nothing cooler than my site!
//
// in his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.
//
// The problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with
// his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able
// to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know
// any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.
// Your Mission
//
// You can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values
// that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you
// will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts
// being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get
// version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:
//
// Your function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code.
// (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.)
// If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it
// is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.
//
// HTML Color Names
//
// (If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)
//
// For HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing
// any of the following colors as specified:
//
// Gold => ForestGreen
// Khaki => LimeGreen
// LemonChiffon => PaleGreen
// LightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen
// LightYellow => MintCream
// PaleGoldenRod => LightGreen
// Yellow => Lime
//
// HTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify
// the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.
//
// Some examples:
//
// "lemonchiffon"    "PaleGreen"
// "GOLD"            "ForestGreen"
// "pAlEgOlDeNrOd"   "LightGreen"
// "BlueViolet"      "BlueViolet"
//
// Hex Color Codes
//
// (If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description.
//   Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known
//   as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first
//   two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)
//
// With six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as "yellow"
// any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value.
// When you find one of these "yellow" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange
// them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R.
//
// For example, with the six-digit hex color code #FFD700, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value
// of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger
// than the B value, you would return it as #00FFD7 -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R.
//
// Hex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case
// they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.
//
// Some examples:
//
// "#000000"   "#000000"
// "#b8860b"   "#0bb886"
// "#8FBC8F"   "#8FBC8F"
// "#C71585"   "#C71585"
//
