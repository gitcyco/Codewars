// 7 kyu 80's Kids #1: How Many Licks Does it Take?
//
// How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop?
//
// A group of engineering students from Purdue University reported that its licking machine, modeled after
// a human tongue, took an average of 364 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.
// Twenty of the group's volunteers assumed the licking challenge-unassisted by machinery-and averaged 252 licks each to the center.
//
// Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to write a function that will return the number of licks
// it took to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, given some environmental variables.
//
// Everyone knows it's harder to lick a tootsie pop in cold weather but it's easier if the sun is out.
// You will be given an object of environmental conditions for each trial paired with a value that will increase or decrease the number of licks.
// The environmental conditions all apply to the same trial.
//
// Assuming that it would normally take 252 licks to get to the tootsie roll center
// of a tootsie pop, return the new total of licks along with the condition that proved to be most
// challenging (causing the most added licks) in that trial.
//
// Example:
//
// totalLicks({ "freezing temps": 10, "clear skies": -2 });
//
// Should return:
//
// "It took 260 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop. The toughest challenge was freezing temps."
//
// Other cases: If there are no challenges, the toughest challenge sentence should be omitted.
// If there are multiple challenges with the highest toughest amount, the first one presented will be the toughest.
// If an environment variable is present, it will be either a positive or negative integer. No need to validate.
//
// Answer:

function totalLicks(env, licks = 252) {
  let mods = Object.entries(env);
  let tough = ["", 0];
  for (let [str, num] of mods) {
    if (num > tough[1]) tough = [` The toughest challenge was ${str}.`, num];
    licks += num;
  }
  return `It took ${licks} licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop.${tough[0]}`;
}
