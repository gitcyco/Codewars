// 7 kyu Scott Orderings and more
//
// Last time we defined Booleans, which have two possible values.
// Respond Proportionately
//
// The question then was Fire the Nukes or Keep the Peace? If we can also Respond Proportionately, if we have a third option, another datatype is necessary:
//
// switch ( option ) {
//   deescalate: keep(peace);
//   reciprocate: respond(proportionately);
//   escalate: fire(nukes);
// }
//
// Or compare two numbers to each other. The three possible outcomes are:
//
// Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
//
// Again, we have Constructors, now three of them. Their order is arbitrary, but we need to agree
// on it, because the order of the function arguments we will later feed into the encodings functions corresponds with it.
// Following the recipe from last time
//
//     For every Constructor, define a curried function that takes as many arguments as there are Constructors
//     ( keeping arguments in order of their enumeration in the type definition ), and returns one of them:
//
// LT = lt => eq => gt => lt
// EQ = lt => eq => gt => eq
// GT = lt => eq => gt => gt
//
// TASK: If you write the functions LT, EQ and GT, the Example Tests will feed them arguments and inspect the answers.
//
// Compare this to the JavaScript convention for sorting values:
//
// x  <  y  <=>  -1 ( or any other negative number )
// x === y  <=>   0
// x  >  y  <=>   1 ( or any other positive number )
//
// Doing a certain operation, making a certain choice, when x < y, means
//
// if ( compare(x,y) < 0 ) keep(peace);
//
// With Scott encoding, that would look like
//
// compare(x,y) (keep(peace)) () ()
//
// Not completely applying an Ordering is pretty useless ( the function will just wait for more arguments ), but there
// may be possibilities for empty values ( SideEffect: do(nothing), Thing: null, Property: undefined ).
// By saturating the Ordering value with arguments, the whole thing again becomes an expression, of the same type as the arguments we supplied.
//
// The first real exercise is determining a sorted list from an input. You are given the function compare, which takes
// two numbers and returns an Ordering. As mentioned, JavaScript sort expects Numbers as the result of a comparison, not Orderings.
// ( See MDN, paragraph "If compareFn is supplied ..". )
//
// TASK: Change sorted so that it works ( do not change compare ).
//
// With the same compare, the next exercise is determining the maximum of a list of numbers.
// By walking the entire list and calculating the maximum of the list so far for every element, calculate the maximum of the entire list.
// ( See MDN, callbackFn. Your callbackFn should return the maximum of accumulator and currentValue. )
//
// TASK: Change maximum so that it works.
// Respond Proportionately
//
// As promised, now the case where there is one possible value:
//
// switch ( option ) {
//   reciprocate: respond(proportionately);
// }
//
// Unit = UNIT
//
// Remember,
//
//     For every Constructor, define a curried function that takes as many arguments as there are Constructors
//     ( keeping arguments in order of their enumeration in the type definition ), and returns one of them.
//
// TASK: If you write the function UNIT, the Example Tests will feed it arguments and inspect the answers.
//
// < pregnant pause >
//
// Well, that was useful.
//
// A datatype that can have only one value does not contain any information. Whatever comes out of the encoded value had to be put in first!
//
// Still, almost every programming language in existence has a Unit datatype ( JavaScript even has two! ).
// They may be named undefined, null, None, NIL, Unit, or () ( the zero-tuple. but don't worry if you don't know what that is ).
// Apparently there is a use for it :] and we may encounter one in a future example on encoding numbers in unary, as lists of .. nothings. But we are not there yet.
// do(nothing) .. or even less?
//
// The case where there are zero possible values. It looks like this:
//
// switch ( option ) {
// }
//
// Void
//
// This case is completely nuts. There is a datatype, but it has no values.
// Because only values are encoded, and not the datatype .. there is no encoding either.
// You do not have to write the function - there is no function; there can be no tests, there are no inputs, no outputs, there is less
// than zero information ( remember, Unit had no information ). So what is the use of a datatype that has no values?
//
// On the value level, there is none. ( It is acceptable to stop reading now. ) But when reasoning about code, at the type level, there
// can be use cases for a Void type. It turns out there are useful things that can be done at the type level, without ever considering
// things as mundane as value implementations. There is a kata about type cardinality, if you are interested ( and can handle 2kyu Haskell ).
// Void also has use in proof languages: an impossibility at the value level can encode a falsehood at the type level.
// Rainbow Colours
//
// To not go out on a note of complete and utter uselessness, a final exercise with a happier subject: rainbows. Remember
//
// Colour = RED | ORANGE | YELLOW | GREEN | BLUE | PURPLE
//
// TASK: If you write functions RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE and PURPLE, the Example Tests will throw things in and show what comes out.
//
// Answer:
const LT = (lt) => (eq) => (gt) => lt;
const EQ = (lt) => (eq) => (gt) => eq;
const GT = (lt) => (eq) => (gt) => gt;

// do not change this function //
function compare(x, y) {
  if (x < y) return LT;
  else if (x > y) return GT;
  else return EQ;
