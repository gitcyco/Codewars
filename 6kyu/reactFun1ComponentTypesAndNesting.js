// 6 kyu React Fun #1: Component types and nesting
//
// What is React?
//
// React is a library for building user interfaces created by Facebook.
// A keyword here is library, meaning that it gives you more power, freedom and responsibility when choosing what other libraries/technologies you want to use with it.
//
// React is built on JavaScript. If you know JS, it's (relatively) easy to start with React - all you have to learn is React-specific stuff and you are good to go.
//
// So, let's dive in!
//
// In React, everything is based on components. There are two kinds of components.
// Function components that work with nothing but props passed to them and class components that can work with both state and props.
//
// Don't worry about state and props for now, we'll get to them later. ;)
// Function components and component nesting
//
// These components are usually defined as pure functions. Meaning that for the same input, they have the same output - no side effects.
//
// They are usually used to display data. They don't change the data they receive, they just render it.
//
// Here is an example:
//
// function Title(){
//     return <h1>Hello</h1>;
// }
//
// Or, with arrow function:
//
// const Title=()=><h1>Hello</h1>;
//
//     NOTE: These tags are not mere HTML. They are JSX, a standard that gets transpiled to JavaScript to generate HTML.
//     To learn more about them, hop here. This will also introduce you to the syntax to create components that was used before.
//     However, I won't get into details about it since the goal of this kata is a bit different :)
//
// If you would like to use this component somewhere, let's say inside another component you'll have to do something like this:
//
// const Title=()=><h1>Hello</h1>;
// const Nest=()=><div> <Title /> </div>; //nesting Title
//
// Simple, isn't it? :)
//
// Here, Nest became a parent component of Title, which in turn, is referred to as the child of Nest.
//
// Notice the <div> tag. In this case, it's not necessary, we could just return
// the <Title /> directly but if we want to have more components returned by one, or repeat the same component, they all need to be wrapped within one tag.
//
// BAD: const Nest=()=><Title /><Title />; This will cause an error.
//
// GOOD: const Nest=()=><div><Title /><Title /></div>;
//
//     TIP: Always start component names with a capital letter.
//     For example, <div /> is a DOM tag but <Title /> would be recognised as a component and would require Title to be in scope.
//
// Class components
//
// Since ES6 introduced advanced class features, React also introduced a way to create components using those same features. Let's look at an example:
//
// class TitleClass extends React.Component {
//     render() {
//         return <h1>Hello</h1>;
//     }
// }
//
// <Title /> and <TitleClass /> are, in this case, doing the same thing - returning Hello wrapped with <h1>.
//
// However, there is one big difference between class components and function components.
//
// Class components give you more power. They can have their own state and they can control their own outputs and outputs of its children. This is a story for another kata.
//
// Time for your task!
// Task
//
//     Create three components. Following the provided rules
//     One component should be named Hello and it should return 'Hello' wrapped inside of h1.
//     The second component should be named World and it should return 'World!' wrapped inside of h2.
//     Create a parent component using class syntax called Greet and nest previous two components inside of it, wrapping them with a div.
//
// If you are stuck, refer to examples provided here. Good luck! :)
//
// There might be some problem with spaces (like you've inserted some extra spaces that make tests fail).
// It's easy to solve them by reading the error message. So it's never a problem. :)
//
// Answer:
const React = require("react");

const Hello = () => {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
};

const World = () => {
  return <h2>World!</h2>;
};

class Greet extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Hello />
        <World />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
