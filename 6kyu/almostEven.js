// 6 kyu Almost Even
//
// We need the ability to divide an unknown integer into a given number of even parts â€” or at least as even as they can be.
// The sum of the parts should be the original value, but each part should be an integer, and they should be as close as possible.
//
// Example code:
//
// splitInteger(20, 6)  // returns [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
//
// Complete the function so that it returns an array of integer representing the parts.
// Ignoring the order of the parts, there is only one valid solution for each input to your function!
//
// (Also, there is no reason to test for edge cases: the input to your function will always be valid for this kata.)
//
// Answer:
/**
 * Returns a [parts]-length array of equal or nearly equal
 * integers that add up to [num].
 */
const splitInteger = (num, parts) => {
  const intPart = parseInt(num / parts);
  const rem = num - intPart * parts;
  const out = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < parts; i++) {
    out.push(intPart);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < rem; i++) {
    out[i]++;
  }
  return out;
};
