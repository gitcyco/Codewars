// 6 kyu I Promise Not To Optimize
//
// This kata is inspired by @Voile's anti-optimizer kata, so you might want to do that one first.
// In that kata, you task yourself to be as inefficient as possible, and delay returning
// the result of a function for at least 11 seconds (to fit into Codewars' 12-second timeout limit).
//
// After you successfully implement your antiOptimize function, the second phase of your
// evil plot kicks into gear, and you deploy anti-optimized code everywhere in your production server.
// But the higher-ups are catching on! -- they demand that functions return their result as quickly as possible, or else you risk being fired.
//
// You wallow in despair, unable to bring your dream of inefficiency to reality, but finally
// realize there's a way you can keep everything woefully inneficient, while still immediately returning values from functions -- Promises!
//
// So now your task is to write the function antiOptimizeAsync, which takes a single parameter
// task (a function), and immediately returns a Promise that only resolves to the return
// value of task() at least 11 seconds (and at most 12 seconds) after antiOptimizeAsync is called.
//
// As with Voile's kata, task will always be an arbitrary function that might run for any duration between 0 to 10 seconds.
//
// Answer:
const { performance } = require("perf_hooks");

function antiOptimizeAsync(task) {
  performance.clearMeasures();
  performance.mark("start");
  const output = task();
  performance.mark("end");
  performance.measure("task", "start", "end");
  const m = performance.getEntriesByType("measure");
  return new Promise((res) => setTimeout(() => res(output), 11000 - m[0].duration));
}
