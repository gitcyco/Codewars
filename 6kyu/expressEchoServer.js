// 6 kyu Express: Echo Server
//
// In this Express exercise, your task is to create an app that responds to GET and POST requests on the / route.
// The responses will echo a message string from the request.
// GET /
//
// This route will read the message parameter and send a JSON response containing the echoed message value.
// The response should have a 200 status.
//
// An example query string is ?message=hello which would be echoed as {"message": "hello"}. An empty string, ?message=, is valid and should be echoed normally.
//
// Respond with a 422 status and the JSON {"error": "'message' was not provided"} when no query parameter message exists.
//
// Respond with a 422 status and the JSON {"error": "'message' was not a string"} when the message was provided, but of a type other than a string.
// POST /
//
// This route will parse the request body as JSON and echo a response containing the value from the "message" key of the request.
// The JSON response is in the same format as the GET above: {"message": "some message"}.
// Set a 200 status on the response to indicate that the request was OK. An empty string ("message": "") is valid and should be echoed.
//
// Respond with a 422 status when no "message" key exists, or if the message type is other than a string.
// The JSON errors for these cases are identical to those used in GET.
//
// For either method, a request is still valid if additional parameters or keys are present in the query or JSON body.
// You can ignore them and echo message as normal.
// Notes
//
// Please use the variable name app to implement your server.
// Don't use app.listen() to start the Express server; the test suite will invoke the route handlers directly on the app object.
//
// Your solution file is automatically included with the test suite, so no export is necessary.
//
// Test input strings consist of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
//
// If you're not familiar with the Express concepts needed to complete this kata, feel free to reference the documentation and other resources as you build your solution.
//
// Answer:
const express = require("express");
