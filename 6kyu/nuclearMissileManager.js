// 6 kyu Nuclear Missile Manager
//
// Our nuclear missile manager system is coded in Node.js. 
// We are currently testing the system and it seems that the launchAll function does not work as expected. 
// It should launch 5 missiles each 1 second apart. 
// The current code tries to launch the missile #5 five times...
// 
// Can you fix this for us? You know, it's pretty critical code...
// 
// Note: There are 5 missiles labeled i which is a number in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The missile i should be launched after i seconds.

// Answer:
const launchAll = lm => {for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) setTimeout(() => lm(i), i * 1000)};
