// 6 kyu Magic The Gathering #3: Spell Stack
//
// Magic The Gathering is a collectible card game that features wizards battling against each other with spells and creature summons.
// The game itself can be quite complicated to learn.
// In this series of katas, we'll be solving some of the situations that arise during gameplay.
// You won't need any prior knowledge of the game to solve these contrived problems, as I will provide you with enough information.
//
// In magic, spells utilize a stack. The last spell onto the stack, is generally the first one to be cast (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out).
// The spell stack was created to give players the chance to respond to a spell before it actually resolves and manifests itself in the game.
// Spells have 2 speeds, instant and sorcery. If a spell is of type instant, it can be cast at any time and in response to other spells.
// If a spell is a sorcery, it may only be cast if the stack is empty. Here are some examples:
//
// The stack is empty.
// Player 1 casts Lightning Bolt (instant).
// Stack -> ['Lightning Bolt']
// Player 2 casts Giant Growth (instant).
// Stack -> ['Lightning Bolt', 'Giant Growth']
// Both players agree that they are done casting spells.
// Giant Growth resolves.
// Stack -> ['Lightning Bolt']
// Lightning Bolt resolves.
// Stack -> []
//
// Create a method of the Magic object called spellStack() that when called without an argument
// returns and removes a spell from the stack in the correct order.
// When passed a spell object, the spell should be added to the stack and the length of the stack should be returned.
// Remember: A sorcery may only be cast when the stack is empty. An instant may be cast at any time.
// If a sorcery is being put on the stack when it's not empty, or if you're trying to cast a spell when the stack is empty, spellStack should throw an error.
// Spells will be passed as an object with the keys name and type:
//
// spellStack({'name':'Lightning Bolt', 'type':'instant'}) -> 1 // Adds lightning bolt to the stack and returns the length of the stack
// spellStack() -> {'name':'Lightning Bolt', 'type':'instant'} // Removes lightning bolt from the stack and returns it
//
// Answer:
class Magic {
  constructor() {
    this.stack = [];
  }
  spellStack(spell) {
    if (spell) {
      if (this.stack.length > 0 && spell.type === "sorcery") throw new Error("stack must be empty");
      this.stack.push(spell);
      return this.stack.length;
    } else {
      if (this.stack.length === 0) throw new Error("empty stack");
      return this.stack.pop();
    }
  }
}
